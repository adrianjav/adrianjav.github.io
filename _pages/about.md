I am a postdoc at the [April lab](https://april-tools.github.io/) working with [Dr. Antonio Vergari](http://nolovedeeplearning.com/) on robust and reliable probabilistic machine learning approaches.

I completed my PhD at the [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://machinelearning.uni-saarland.de/) group working with [Prof. Isabel Valera](https://ivaleram.github.io/) at [Saarland University](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/).
Before that, I worked at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/) in Tübingen at the Empirical Inference department and the Probabilistic Machine Learning group.

My research focuses on developing methods that are reliable, principled, and efficient. 
Loosely, I introduce inductive biases to models such that they comply with our expectations on how they should behave in the wild. 
My ultimate goal is to conduct interesting and principled research to better understand machine learning models and ease their deployment in the real-world.
